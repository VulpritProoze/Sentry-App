# Two-Tier Crash Detection Approach

## Implementation Checklist

> **Status**: Phase 1 Partially Complete | **Last Updated**: 2025
> 
> This checklist tracks all implementation tasks for the two-tier crash detection system. The implementation is divided into two phases:
> - **Phase 1**: Tier 1 - Client-Side Fast Threshold Detection (immediate alerts)
> - **Phase 2**: Tier 2 - Backend AI Analysis (intelligent confirmation)
> 
> Complete Phase 1 first to get basic crash detection working, then implement Phase 2 for AI-powered confirmation.

### Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Communication

#### Purpose
The embedded ESP32 device communicates with the mobile app via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The device sends MPU6050 sensor data every 2 seconds to the client app.

#### Why BLE?
- **Low Power**: BLE is designed for battery-efficient communication
- **Range**: Suitable for helmet-to-phone communication (typically 10-30 meters)
- **ESP32 Support**: ESP32 has built-in BLE support
- **Real-time**: 2-second intervals provide near real-time monitoring without excessive battery drain

#### Implementation

**Dependencies**:
```bash
npm install react-native-ble-manager
# or for Expo
npx expo install expo-bluetooth
```

**File**: `frontend/services/bluetooth/bleManager.ts`

#### ESP32 BLE Configuration

The ESP32 device should be configured to:
- Advertise as "Sentry Device" or similar name
- Send sensor data every 2 seconds via BLE characteristic
- Use a consistent service UUID and characteristic UUID
- Format data as JSON: `{"ax": 0.1, "ay": 0.2, "az": 0.98, "roll": 2.3, "pitch": 1.1, "tilt_detected": false}`

**Note**: 2-second intervals provide a good balance between:
- **Real-time monitoring**: Fast enough to detect crashes quickly
- **Battery efficiency**: Not too frequent to drain device battery
- **Data volume**: Manageable amount of data to process

### State Management (Hybrid Approach)

#### Purpose
Use a hybrid approach: **TanStack Query** for server state (API data) and **React Context** for local/client state (BLE connection, UI state).

#### Why This Approach?

**TanStack Query for Server State:**
- **Automatic caching**: Reduces unnecessary API calls
- **Background refetching**: Keeps data fresh automatically
- **Optimistic updates**: Better UX for mutations
- **Error handling**: Built-in retry and error states
- **Loading states**: Automatic loading state management

**React Context for Local State:**
- **Simple**: Perfect for BLE connection status, UI state
- **No dependencies**: Built into React
- **Lightweight**: No overhead for simple state

#### Setup TanStack Query

**Installation**:
```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query
```

**File**: `frontend/lib/queryClient.ts`

```typescript
import { QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

export const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // 5 minutes
      gcTime: 1000 * 60 * 10, // 10 minutes (garbage collection time)
      retry: 1,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
    },
    mutations: {
      retry: 1,
    },
  },
});
```

**File**: `frontend/app/_layout.tsx` (Update)

```typescript
import { QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { queryClient } from '@/lib/queryClient';
import { DeviceProvider } from '@/context/DeviceContext';
import { CrashProvider } from '@/context/CrashContext';

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <DeviceProvider>
        <CrashProvider>
          {/* Your app content */}
        </CrashProvider>
      </DeviceProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

#### TanStack Query Hooks for Server State

**File**: `frontend/hooks/queries/useCrashEvents.ts`

```typescript
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { apiClient } from '@/services/api/client';
import { CrashEvent } from '@/types/crash';

export function useCrashEvents(deviceId: string) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['crashEvents', deviceId],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const response = await apiClient.get<CrashEvent[]>(
        `/api/v1/device/${deviceId}/crash-events`
      );
      return response.data;
    },
    enabled: !!deviceId,
    refetchInterval: 30000, // Refetch every 30 seconds
  });
}
```

**File**: `frontend/hooks/queries/useCrashHistory.ts`

```typescript
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { apiClient } from '@/services/api/client';
import { CrashEvent } from '@/types/crash';

interface UseCrashHistoryOptions {
  deviceId: string;
  startDate?: string;
  endDate?: string;
}

export function useCrashHistory(options: UseCrashHistoryOptions) {
  const { deviceId, startDate, endDate } = options;

  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['crashHistory', deviceId, startDate, endDate],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const params = new URLSearchParams();
      if (startDate) params.append('start_date', startDate);
      if (endDate) params.append('end_date', endDate);

      const response = await apiClient.get<CrashEvent[]>(
        `/api/v1/device/${deviceId}/crash-history?${params.toString()}`
      );
      return response.data;
    },
    enabled: !!deviceId,
  });
}
```

#### TanStack Query Mutations

> **Note**: This is Phase 2 implementation. Not needed in Phase 1.

**File**: `frontend/hooks/mutations/useSendCrashAlert.ts` (Phase 2)

```typescript
import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { sendCrashAlert, CrashAlertRequest, CrashAlertResponse } from '@/services/api/crash';
import { showLocalNotification } from '@/services/fcm/notifications';

export function useSendCrashAlert() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: (data: CrashAlertRequest) => sendCrashAlert(data),
    onSuccess: (response: CrashAlertResponse) => {
      // Invalidate crash events query to refetch
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['crashEvents'] });

      // Show notification based on AI response
      if (response.is_crash) {
        showLocalNotification({
          title: '🚨 CRASH CONFIRMED',
          body: `Severity: ${response.severity} | ${response.reasoning}`,
          data: { type: 'crash_confirmed', ...response },
        });
      } else {
        showLocalNotification({
          title: '✅ False Alarm',
          body: 'AI analysis indicates no crash occurred.',
          data: { type: 'false_positive' },
        });
      }
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      console.error('Error sending crash alert:', error);
      // Keep threshold alert active if API fails
    },
  });
}
```

**File**: `frontend/hooks/mutations/useCrashFeedback.ts`

```typescript
import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { apiClient } from '@/services/api/client';

interface CrashFeedbackRequest {
  crashEventId: string;
  isCrash: boolean;
  falsePositive: boolean;
  comments?: string;
}

export function useCrashFeedback() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: async (data: CrashFeedbackRequest) => {
      const response = await apiClient.post(
        `/api/v1/device/events/${data.crashEventId}/feedback`,
        data
      );
      return response.data;
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
      // Invalidate queries to refetch updated data
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['crashEvents'] });
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['crashHistory'] });
    },
  });
}
```

#### React Context for Local State

**File**: `frontend/context/DeviceContext.tsx`

```typescript
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { SensorReading } from '@/types/device';
import { BLEManager } from '@/services/bluetooth/bleManager';

interface DeviceContextType {
  isConnected: boolean;
  currentReading: SensorReading | null;
  connect: (deviceId: string) => Promise<boolean>;
  disconnect: () => Promise<void>;
  startReceiving: () => void;
  stopReceiving: () => void;
}

const DeviceContext = createContext<DeviceContextType | undefined>(undefined);

export function DeviceProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [isConnected, setIsConnected] = useState(false);
  const [currentReading, setCurrentReading] = useState<SensorReading | null>(null);
  const [bleManager] = useState(() => new BLEManager());

  const connect = useCallback(async (deviceId: string) => {
    const connected = await bleManager.connect(deviceId);
    setIsConnected(connected);
    return connected;
  }, [bleManager]);

  const disconnect = useCallback(async () => {
    await bleManager.disconnect();
    setIsConnected(false);
    setCurrentReading(null);
  }, [bleManager]);

  const startReceiving = useCallback(() => {
    bleManager.setDataCallback((data: SensorReading) => {
      setCurrentReading(data);
    });
  }, [bleManager]);

  const stopReceiving = useCallback(() => {
    bleManager.setDataCallback(() => {});
  }, [bleManager]);

  return (
    <DeviceContext.Provider
      value={{
        isConnected,
        currentReading,
        connect,
        disconnect,
        startReceiving,
        stopReceiving,
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </DeviceContext.Provider>
  );
}

export function useDevice() {
  const context = useContext(DeviceContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useDevice must be used within DeviceProvider');
  }
  return context;
}
```

**File**: `frontend/context/CrashContext.tsx`

```typescript
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { ThresholdResult } from '@/types/crash';

interface CrashContextType {
  lastCrashAlert: ThresholdResult | null;
  isProcessing: boolean;
  setLastCrashAlert: (alert: ThresholdResult | null) => void;
  setProcessing: (processing: boolean) => void;
}

const CrashContext = createContext<CrashContextType | undefined>(undefined);

export function CrashProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [lastCrashAlert, setLastCrashAlert] = useState<ThresholdResult | null>(null);
  const [isProcessing, setProcessing] = useState(false);

  return (
    <CrashContext.Provider
      value={{
        lastCrashAlert,
        isProcessing,
        setLastCrashAlert,
        setProcessing,
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </CrashContext.Provider>
  );
}

export function useCrash() {
  const context = useContext(CrashContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useCrash must be used within CrashProvider');
  }
  return context;
}
```

**Usage Example**:

```typescript
// In any component - Using TanStack Query for server state
import { useCrashEvents } from '@/hooks/queries/useCrashEvents';
import { useSendCrashAlert } from '@/hooks/mutations/useSendCrashAlert';
import { useDevice } from '@/context/DeviceContext'; // Local state

function CrashHistoryScreen() {
  const { isConnected } = useDevice(); // Local state from Context
  const { data: crashEvents, isLoading, error } = useCrashEvents('device-123'); // Server state from Query
  const sendCrashAlert = useSendCrashAlert();

  if (isLoading) return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
  if (error) return <Text>Error loading crash events</Text>;

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Connected: {isConnected ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</Text>
      {crashEvents?.map((event) => (
        <CrashEventCard key={event.id} event={event} />
      ))}
    </View>
  );
}
```

#### Summary

- **TanStack Query**: Use for all API calls (GET requests, mutations)
  - Crash events, crash history, device data from server
  - Automatic caching, refetching, error handling
  
- **React Context**: Use for local/client-side state
  - BLE connection status
  - Current sensor reading from BLE
  - UI state (modals, alerts)
  - Temporary state that doesn't need persistence

### Threshold Detection Logic

**File**: `frontend/services/crash/threshold.ts`

```typescript

## GPS Integration

### Overview

GPS location data is integrated throughout the two-tier crash detection system to provide location information when crashes are detected. The GPS data flow is designed to:

1. **Tier 1 (Client)**: Store GPS data locally, only sending to backend when crash is detected
2. **Tier 2 (Backend)**: Store GPS location with crash events and send to loved ones when crash confirmed

### GPS Data Flow

```
ESP32 Device (GPS Module)
    │
    │ Every 2 seconds
    ▼
BLE Transmission (GPS Data)
    │
    │ {type: "gps_data", gps: {fix, satellites, latitude, longitude, altitude}}
    ▼
Mobile App (Tier 1 - Client)
    │
    │ Parse GPS data from BLE
    │ Store in DeviceContext (local only)
    │
    │ When crash detected (threshold exceeded)
    ▼
Backend API (Tier 2)
    │
    │ Store GPS in CrashEvent
    │ If crash confirmed by AI
    ▼
Loved Ones Notification
    │
    │ FCM Push Notification with GPS location
    │ (latitude, longitude, map link)
    ▼
Loved Ones (Emergency Contacts)
```

### Phase 1: GPS Data Reception and Storage (Client-Side Only)

#### ESP32 Device (Already Implemented ✅)

The ESP32 device already sends GPS data via BLE every 2 seconds:

**Format**: JSON packet
```json
{
  "type": "gps_data",
  "sequence": 123,
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "gps": {
    "fix": true,
    "satellites": 8,
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194,
    "altitude": 100.5
  },
  "crc": 12345
}
```

**BLE Characteristic**: `CHAR_GPS_DATA_UUID` = `"0000ff02-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"`

#### Frontend Implementation (Phase 1)

**1. Parse GPS Data in BLE Manager**

File: `frontend/services/bluetooth/bleManager.ts`

```typescript
// Add GPS data callback
private onGPSDataReceived?: (data: GPSData) => void;

// Subscribe to GPS characteristic
async subscribeToGPSData(deviceId: string): Promise<void> {
  await this.manager.startNotification(
    deviceId,
    SERVICE_UUID,
    GPS_DATA_CHARACTERISTIC_UUID
  );
  
  // Listen for GPS data updates
  this.manager.addListener(
    'BleManagerDidUpdateValueForCharacteristic',
    ({ value, characteristic }: { value: number[]; characteristic: string }) => {
      if (characteristic === GPS_DATA_CHARACTERISTIC_UUID) {
        const gpsData = this.parseGPSData(value);
        this.onGPSDataReceived?.(gpsData);
      }
    }
  );
}

// Parse GPS JSON data
private parseGPSData(value: number[]): GPSData | null {
  try {
    const dataString = String.fromCharCode(...value);
    const data = JSON.parse(dataString);
    
    if (data.type === 'gps_data' && data.gps) {
      return {
        fix: data.gps.fix || false,
        satellites: data.gps.satellites || 0,
        latitude: data.gps.latitude || null,
        longitude: data.gps.longitude || null,
        altitude: data.gps.altitude || null,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      };
    }
    return null;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error parsing GPS data:', error);
    return null;
  }
}

// Set GPS data callback
setGPSDataCallback(callback: (data: GPSData) => void): void {
  this.onGPSDataReceived = callback;
}
```

**2. Store GPS Data in DeviceContext**

File: `frontend/context/DeviceContext.tsx`

```typescript
interface DeviceContextType {
  // ... existing fields
  currentGPSData: GPSData | null;
  // ... rest of interface
}

export function DeviceProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [currentGPSData, setCurrentGPSData] = useState<GPSData | null>(null);
  
  // ... existing code
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isConnected) {
      // Set GPS data callback
      bleManager.setGPSDataCallback((gpsData: GPSData) => {
        setCurrentGPSData(gpsData);
      });
    }
  }, [isConnected]);
  
  return (
    <DeviceContext.Provider
      value={{
        // ... existing values
        currentGPSData,
        // ... rest of values
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </DeviceContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

**3. TypeScript Types**

File: `frontend/types/device.ts`

```typescript
export interface GPSData {
  fix: boolean;
  satellites: number;
  latitude: number | null;
  longitude: number | null;
  altitude: number | null;
  timestamp: string;
}
```

**Note**: In Phase 1, GPS data is stored locally only. It is NOT sent to the backend until a crash is detected (Phase 2).

### Phase 2: GPS Data Transmission and Notification

#### Frontend: Include GPS in Crash Alert

**Update Crash Detection Hook**

File: `frontend/hooks/useCrashDetection.ts`

```typescript
import { useDevice } from '@/context/DeviceContext';

export function useCrashDetection(
  sensorData: SensorReading | null,
  options: UseCrashDetectionOptions = {}
) {
  const { currentGPSData } = useDevice(); // Get GPS data from context
  const sendCrashAlertMutation = useSendCrashAlert();
  
  // ... existing code
  
  if (result.isTriggered) {
    // Include GPS data in crash alert
    sendCrashAlertMutation.mutate({
      device_id: sensorData.device_id,
      sensor_reading: sensorData,
      threshold_result: result,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      gps_data: currentGPSData, // Add GPS data
    });
  }
}
```

**Update API Types**

File: `frontend/types/api.ts`

```typescript
import { GPSData } from './device';

export interface CrashAlertRequest {
  device_id: string;
  sensor_reading: SensorReading;
  threshold_result: ThresholdResult;
  timestamp: string;
  gps_data: GPSData | null; // GPS data (may be null if no fix)
}
```

#### Backend: Store GPS in CrashEvent

**1. Update CrashEvent Model**

File: `backend/sentry/device/models/crash_event.py`

```python
class CrashEvent(models.Model):
    # ... existing fields
    
    # GPS Location at Crash Time
    crash_latitude = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)
    crash_longitude = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)
    crash_altitude = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)
    gps_fix_at_crash = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    satellites_at_crash = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
    
    # ... rest of model
```

**2. Update Crash Alert Schema**

File: `backend/sentry/device/schemas/crash_schema.py`

```python
class GPSDataSchema(BaseModel):
    fix: bool
    satellites: int
    latitude: float | None
    longitude: float | None
    altitude: float | None
    timestamp: str

class CrashAlertRequest(BaseModel):
    device_id: str
    sensor_reading: SensorReadingSchema
    threshold_result: ThresholdResultSchema
    timestamp: str
    gps_data: GPSDataSchema | None = None  # Optional GPS data
```

**3. Update Crash Controller**

File: `backend/sentry/device/controllers/crash_controller.py`

```python
def process_crash_alert(
    request: HttpRequest,
    data: CrashAlertRequest,
) -> CrashAlertResponse:
    # ... existing AI analysis code
    
    if ai_analysis["is_crash"]:
        crash_event = CrashEvent.objects.create(
            # ... existing fields
            crash_latitude=data.gps_data.latitude if data.gps_data and data.gps_data.fix else None,
            crash_longitude=data.gps_data.longitude if data.gps_data and data.gps_data.fix else None,
            crash_altitude=data.gps_data.altitude if data.gps_data and data.gps_data.fix else None,
            gps_fix_at_crash=data.gps_data.fix if data.gps_data else False,
            satellites_at_crash=data.gps_data.satellites if data.gps_data else None,
        )
        
        # Send notifications to loved ones with GPS location
        if ai_analysis["severity"] in ["high", "medium"]:
            fcm_service.send_crash_notification(
                device_id=data.device_id,
                crash_event=crash_event,
                ai_analysis=ai_analysis,
            )
            # Send GPS location to loved ones
            notify_loved_ones_with_gps(
                device_id=data.device_id,
                crash_event=crash_event,
            )
```

#### Backend: Notify Loved Ones with GPS Location

**1. Update FCM Service**

File: `backend/sentry/device/services/fcm_service.py`

```python
def send_crash_notification(
    self,
    device_id: str,
    crash_event: CrashEvent,
    ai_analysis: dict,
) -> None:
    """Send crash notification with GPS location."""
    
    # Get GPS location

        gps_location = {
            "latitude": crash_event.crash_latitude,
            "longitude": crash_event.crash_longitude,
            "altitude": crash_event.crash_altitude,
        }
        # Create map link (Google Maps)
        map_link = f"https://www.google.com/maps?q={crash_event.crash_latitude},{crash_event.crash_longitude}"
    else:
        map_link = None
    
    # Build notification message
    message = {
        "title": f"🚨 Crash Detected - {ai_analysis['severity'].upper()}",
        "body": f"{ai_analysis['crash_type']} - {ai_analysis['reasoning'][:100]}...",
        "data": {

        },
    }
    
    # Send to device owner
    # ... existing notification code
    
def notify_loved_ones_with_gps(
    device_id: str,
    crash_event: CrashEvent,
) -> None:
    """Send GPS location to all active loved ones for the device owner."""
    from core.models import LovedOne, User
    
    # Get device owner (user)
    user = crash_event.user
    if not user:
        logger.warning(f"No user associated with crash event {crash_event.id}")
        return
    
    # Get all active loved ones
    loved_ones = LovedOne.objects.filter(
        user=user,
        is_active=True
    ).select_related("loved_one")
    
    # Get GPS location
    if not (crash_event.crash_latitude and crash_event.crash_longitude):
        logger.warning(f"No GPS location for crash event {crash_event.id}")
        return
    
    map_link = f"https://www.google.com/maps?q={crash_event.crash_latitude},{crash_event.crash_longitude}"
    
    # Send notification to each loved one
    for loved_one_rel in loved_ones:
        loved_one_user = loved_one_rel.loved_one

                        "latitude": crash_event.crash_latitude,
                        "longitude": crash_event.crash_longitude,
                        "altitude": crash_event.crash_altitude,
                    },
                    "map_link": map_link,
                },
            }
            
            self._send_expo_notification(
                expo_push_token=device_token.fcm_token,
                message=message,
            )
```

### GPS Data Storage Strategy

**Option 1: Store GPS with Sensor Data (Recommended)**
- Store GPS data in `SensorData` model alongside sensor readings
- Allows historical GPS tracking
- Useful for AI analysis context

**Option 2: Store GPS Only in CrashEvent**
- Store GPS only when crash detected
- Simpler, less storage
- Sufficient for crash notifications

**Recommendation**: Use Option 1 for comprehensive tracking, but ensure GPS is always included in CrashEvent for emergency notifications.

### Testing GPS Integration

1. **Test GPS Data Reception (Phase 1)**
   - Verify GPS data parsed from BLE
   - Verify GPS data stored in DeviceContext
   - Test with GPS fix and without fix

2. **Test GPS in Crash Alert (Phase 2)**
   - Verify GPS included in crash alert request
   - Verify GPS stored in CrashEvent
   - Test with null GPS data (no fix)

3. **Test Loved Ones Notification**
   - Verify loved ones receive GPS location
   - Verify map link works correctly
   - Test with multiple loved ones

## Tier 2: Backend AI Analysis with Gemini

### Purpose
Perform intelligent crash analysis using Gemini AI API to confirm or deny threshold triggers, reducing false positives and providing detailed crash insights.

### Implementation Location
**Backend**: `backend/sentry/`

### Flow

1. **Receive Threshold Alert from Mobile App**
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/device/crash/alert`
   - Receives sensor data + threshold result

2. **Retrieve Recent Context**
   - Fetch last 30 seconds of sensor data from database
   - Format for Gemini AI analysis

3. **Call Gemini AI**
   - Create optimized prompt
   - Send to Gemini API
   - Parse JSON response

4. **Process AI Response**
   - If confirmed crash → Create CrashEvent, send FCM push notification
   - If false positive → Log for learning, optionally notify user

5. **Send Push Notification via FCM**
   - High severity → Immediate notification
   - Medium severity → Delayed notification
   - Low severity → Log only

### Backend Endpoint

**Note**: Following the backend guide conventions:
- Controllers contain business logic
- Services (like `FCMService`, `GeminiService`) are used for external integrations
- Complex model-specific logic should go in `utils/{model_name}_utils.py`
- Import organization: standard library → third-party → Django → local imports

from device.controllers.device_controller import receive_device_data
from device.schemas import DeviceDataRequest, DeviceDataResponse
from .crash_router import crash_router

device_router = Router(tags=["device"], auth=DeviceAPIKeyAuth())

    return receive_device_data(request, payload)

# Register crash router
device_router.add_router("crash", crash_router)
```

The `device_router` is already registered in `api/v1/router.py`, so the crash endpoint will be available at `/api/v1/device/crash/alert`.

## Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Integration

### Purpose
Send push notifications to mobile app users when crashes are detected and confirmed by AI.

### Backend Setup

#### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install httpx>=0.27.0
```

#### 2. FCM Service (Using Expo Push Notification API)

**File**: `backend/sentry/device/services/fcm_service.py`

**Note**: The implementation uses Expo Push Notification Service API instead of Firebase Admin SDK directly. This approach:
- Works with Expo Push Tokens (returned by `expo-notifications` library)
- No need for Firebase Admin SDK or service account credentials
- Simpler setup for Expo-based apps
- Uses `httpx` library to make HTTP POST requests to Expo's API

Key implementation details:
- `send_crash_notification()`: Sends crash notification via Expo Push API
- `send_test_notification()`: Sends test notification for testing purposes
- `_get_expo_push_token()`: Retrieves Expo Push Token from `DeviceToken` model
- `_send_expo_notification()`: Handles HTTP POST to Expo API with proper response parsing
- Supports nested response format: `{"data": {"status": "ok", "id": "..."}}`
- Error handling with proper logging

**Dependencies**:
- `httpx` library for HTTP requests
- `DeviceToken` model (stores Expo Push Tokens in `fcm_token` field)

#### 3. Configuration

**File**: `backend/sentry/sentry/settings/config.py`

Add to the `Settings` class:
```python
# Push notification settings (Expo)
expo_push_api_url: str = Field(
    default="https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send",
    description="Expo Push Notification API endpoint URL",
)
# FCM settings (deprecated - using Expo Push API now)
fcm_credentials_path: str | None = Field(
    default=None,
    description="Path to Firebase service account JSON file (deprecated - not used with Expo Push API)",
)
```

**Note**: `fcm_credentials_path` is kept for backward compatibility but is not used with Expo Push API implementation.

### Frontend Setup

#### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npx expo install expo-notifications expo-device expo-constants
```

**Note**: No need for `@react-native-firebase/app` or `@react-native-firebase/messaging` when using Expo Push Notification Service.

#### 2. Notification Service

**File**: `frontend/services/notifications/notificationService.ts`

**Note**: This is implemented using `expo-notifications` library and Expo Push Notification Service.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Uses `expo-notifications` for Expo Push Token generation
- Token is sent to backend endpoint: `/api/v1/device/mobile/fcm/token`
- Backend uses Expo Push API to send notifications using the Expo Push Token
- Handles both local notifications and push notifications
- Supports periodic notifications for testing
- Error handling for missing FCM configuration on Android

**Key Methods**:
- `getPushToken()`: Gets Expo Push Token (format: `ExponentPushToken[...]`)
- `sendLocalNotification()`: Sends immediate local notification
- `startPeriodicNotifications()`: Starts periodic test notifications
- `setupNotificationListeners()`: Sets up foreground/background notification handlers

#### 3. useFCM Hook

**File**: `frontend/hooks/useFCM.ts`

**Implementation Notes**:
- Automatically registers for push notifications on mount
- Sends Expo Push Token to backend on registration
- Provides test notification functions (local and backend)
- Manages notification state (token, registration status, periodic notifications)
- Handles notification listeners setup and cleanup

#### 4. Backend Test Notification Endpoint

**File**: `backend/sentry/device/router/mobile_router.py`

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/device/mobile/fcm/token` - Register Expo Push Token
- `POST /api/v1/device/mobile/fcm/test` - Send test push notification

**Note**: Both endpoints require JWT authentication.

#### 5. Notification Component

> **Note**: This is Phase 2 implementation. In Phase 1, use `console.log()` instead of notifications.

**Note**: Local notification functionality is implemented in `notificationService.ts` via `sendLocalNotification()` method. The `useFCM` hook provides convenient wrapper functions for testing.

#### 6. App Initialization

**File**: `frontend/app/(tabs)/home.tsx` (update)

**Note**: Push notification registration happens automatically in the `useFCM` hook when components mount. The hook:
- Registers for push notifications
- Sends token to backend
- Sets up notification listeners
- Provides test notification functions

Example usage:
```typescript
const { 
  pushToken, 
  isRegistered, 
  sendTestNotification,
  sendBackendTestNotification,
} = useFCM();
```

## Data Flow Summary

### Complete Flow

1. **ESP32 Device (Embedded)**
   - Reads MPU6050 sensor data (accelerometer + gyroscope)
   - Calculates roll, pitch, and tilt detection
   - Reads GPS data (latitude, longitude, altitude, satellites, fix status)
   - Sends sensor data via **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** to mobile app
   - Sends GPS data via **BLE** to mobile app (same interval)
   - **Transmission interval: Every 2 seconds** (good balance between real-time monitoring and battery efficiency)
   - Sensor data format: `{ax, ay, az, roll, pitch, tilt_detected, timestamp}`
   - GPS data format: `{type: "gps_data", gps: {fix, satellites, latitude, longitude, altitude}}`

2. **Mobile App (Tier 1 - Client-Side)**
   - Receives sensor data via BLE connection
   - Receives GPS data via BLE connection (stored locally in DeviceContext)
   - Calculates G-force: `sqrt(ax² + ay² + az²)`
   - Checks thresholds:
     - G-force ≥ 8g (configurable)
     - Tilt ≥ 90° (configurable)
   - If threshold exceeded:
     - **Phase 1**: Logs to console with threshold details (<100ms)
     - **Phase 2**: Sends alert to backend API with sensor data + GPS location
   - GPS data stored locally only (not sent to backend until crash detected)
   - Continues receiving data every 2 seconds

3. **Backend (Tier 2 - AI Analysis)**
   - Receives threshold alert from mobile app (with GPS location if available)
   - Retrieves recent sensor data context (last 30 seconds from database)
   - Formats data for Gemini AI
   - Calls Gemini AI API for intelligent analysis
   - Processes AI response (is_crash, confidence, severity, reasoning)
   - If confirmed crash:
     - Creates CrashEvent in database (with GPS location)
     - Sends FCM push notification to mobile app (with GPS location)
     - Sends GPS location to all active loved ones (emergency contacts)
   - If false positive:
     - Logs for learning/improvement
     - Optionally notifies user of false alarm

4. **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**
   - Delivers push notification to mobile app (device owner)
   - Delivers push notification to loved ones (emergency contacts)
   - App receives notification (foreground/background/quit state)
   - Notification includes: severity, crash type, AI reasoning, GPS location, map link

5. **Mobile App (User Notification)**
   - Receives FCM push notification
   - Shows enhanced alert with AI analysis details
   - User can:
     - View crash details
     - Dismiss alert
     - Send emergency SOS
     - Provide feedback (true crash / false positive)

### Timing Breakdown

- **BLE Data Transmission**: Every 2 seconds (from ESP32 to mobile app)
- **Tier 1 (Client Threshold Check)**: <100ms (immediate, on-device calculation)
- **Tier 2 (Backend AI Analysis)**: 1-3 seconds (Gemini API call + processing)
- **FCM Delivery**: <1 second (push notification delivery)
- **Total Alert Time**: ~2-4 seconds from threshold trigger to user notification
- **Maximum Detection Latency**: ~4-6 seconds (2s data interval + 2-4s processing)

**Note**: The 2-second data transmission interval is a good balance:
- **Fast enough** to detect crashes quickly (within 2-4 seconds)
- **Battery efficient** for ESP32 device (BLE is low power)
- **Manageable data volume** for processing and storage

## Configuration

### Threshold Configuration

**File**: `frontend/utils/constants.ts`

```typescript
export const CRASH_DETECTION_CONFIG = {
  gForceThreshold: 8.0,        // G-force threshold (8g)
  tiltThreshold: 90.0,         // Tilt threshold (90 degrees)
  consecutiveTriggers: 2,      // Require 2 consecutive triggers
  lookbackSeconds: 30,         // Context window for AI (30 seconds)
} as const;
```

### Backend Configuration

**File**: `backend/sentry/sentry/settings/config.py`

```python
# Gemini AI
gemini_api_key: str | None = None
gemini_model: str = "gemini-pro"
gemini_analysis_lookback_seconds: int = 30

# FCM
fcm_credentials_path: str | None = None

# Crash Detection
crash_confidence_threshold: float = 0.7  # Minimum confidence for alert
crash_high_severity_g_force: float = 15.0
crash_medium_severity_g_force: float = 12.0
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Tier 1 Testing (Client)

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test threshold calculations
   - Test G-force and tilt calculations
   - Test consecutive trigger logic

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test API calls to backend (Phase 2)
   - Test console logging on threshold (Phase 1)
   - Test hook behavior

### Tier 2 Testing (Backend)

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test Gemini service
   - Test FCM service
   - Test crash event creation

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test full flow: alert → AI → notification
   - Test with mock Gemini responses
   - Test FCM token management

### End-to-End Testing

1. **Simulate Crash**
   - Send high G-force data from mobile app
   - **Phase 1**: Verify console log shows threshold exceeded
   - **Phase 2**: Verify backend AI analysis
   - **Phase 2**: Verify FCM push notification

2. **False Positive Testing**
   - Send normal sensor data
   - Verify no alerts triggered
   - Verify AI correctly identifies false positive

---

## Performance Considerations

### Client-Side (Tier 1)

- **CPU Usage**: Minimal (simple math calculations)
- **Battery Impact**: Low (no network calls for threshold check)
- **Memory**: Minimal (only stores recent trigger history)

### Backend (Tier 2)

- **Response Time**: 1-3 seconds (Gemini API latency)
- **Cost**: Only calls Gemini when threshold triggered (cost optimization)
- **Scalability**: Use async task queue (Celery) for high volume

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Client-Side**
   - Debounce threshold checks (check every N readings, not every reading)
   - Use Web Workers for calculations if needed
   - Cache threshold config

2. **Backend**
   - Cache recent sensor data queries
   - Use connection pooling for database
   - Batch FCM notifications if multiple devices

---

## Security Considerations

1. **API Authentication**
   - Use device API key for device endpoints
   - Use JWT for user endpoints

2. **FCM Token Security**
   - Store tokens securely in database
   - Validate tokens before sending notifications
   - Implement token refresh mechanism

3. **Data Privacy**
   - Encrypt sensitive sensor data
   - Anonymize data for AI analysis if needed
   - Comply with GDPR/privacy regulations

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Offline Support**
   - Queue threshold alerts when offline
   - Sync when connection restored

2. **Machine Learning**
   - Train custom model on collected data
   - Improve threshold accuracy

3. **Multi-Device Support**
   - Aggregate analysis across multiple devices
   - Fleet-level insights

4. **Emergency Services Integration**
   - Auto-dial emergency services for high-severity crashes
   - Include location data

---

## Conclusion

This two-tier approach provides:
- **Speed**: Immediate alerts via client-side threshold detection
- **Accuracy**: AI confirmation reduces false positives
- **User Experience**: Fast response with intelligent analysis
- **Cost Efficiency**: Only calls Gemini API when needed

The hybrid system balances the need for immediate alerts with intelligent analysis, providing the best of both worlds.
